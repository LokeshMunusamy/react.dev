QA Touch, user access defines how effectively your QA team can collaborate. Whether you’re running functional test cases, managing test runs, or filing bugs, assigning users to the right projects ensures everyone has the right visibility and access.

1. You are logged in as an Admin or a user with the permission to manage project access.
2. The user(s) you're assigning have already been added to your QA Touch organization.
3. You've created at least one project that is active or in progress.
