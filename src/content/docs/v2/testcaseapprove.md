### What is an approve/reject/re-verify test case ? {/*what-is-an-approverejectre-verify-test-case-*/}

1. **Approve:** When a test case is approved, it means that it has been reviewed and verified. Test cases are typically approved by a test manager or lead after ensuring they meet the necessary criteria, and relevance to the project requirements.

2. **Reject:** Test cases can be rejected for various reasons, such as incomplete or outdated information, unclear steps, or inaccuracies in the expected results. When a test case is rejected, it is usually sent back to the tester or test lead for revision and improvement.

3. **Re-verify:** After a rejected test case has been revised and updated, it needs to be re-verified to ensure that the issues have been addressed and that the test case now meets the required standards. If the test case passes the re-verification process, it may be approved again for use in testing.
