title: Shareable Public Reports by Test Case
---

### Overview {/*overview*/}

Shareable Public Reports by Test Case - Type, Priority, and Test Suite provide a concise view of test results filtered and grouped by each test case’s classification. These reports summarize the execution and outcome of tests, allowing users to publicly share progress or quality metrics segmented by:

1. Type (e.g., functional, regression, integration)
2. Priority (e.g., critical, high, medium, low)
3. Test Suite (e.g., login tests, checkout flow, API endpoints)

This format helps both teams and stakeholders track overall test coverage and quality in real time, focusing on the areas that matter most for their specific roles or concerns.
